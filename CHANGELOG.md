# Changelog

## 0.1.0 - Unreleased

### Added
- Lifecycle management commands: `voiccce doctor` runs health checks (config, database, hooks wired per agent, hook-wrapper import, OpenAI key validity, audio tools, daemon heartbeat, mute state, failed events) and exits non-zero on any failure; supports `--no-validate-key` and `--json`. `voiccce logs` tails a log file (`--daemon`/`--menubar`/`--hook`/`--summary`, `-n`, `-f`). `voiccce prune [--older-than 30d]` deletes old processed events and VACUUMs the database. `voiccce clear [--events] [--history] [--all] [--yes]` clears the queue and/or notification history. `voiccce --version` / `-V` prints the installed version.
- `voiccce autostart {enable,disable,status}` — opt-in macOS `launchd` autostart for the daemon (and menu bar app), off by default, so Voiccce can come back after a reboot or login.
- `voiccce uninstall [target] [--purge] [--restore-backups] [--yes]`. With a target it unwires one integration's hooks; with no target it tears down everything: stops the daemon and menu bar, strips the `VOICCCE=1` hook blocks from every wired agent, deletes the OpenAI key from the Keychain, disables autostart, and prints the package-removal follow-up (`pipx`/`pip`). Keeps `~/.voiccce` unless `--purge`.
- New `voiccce config` flags: `--summary {on,off}`, `--summary-privacy {metadata_only,full_last_message}`, `--summary-model`, `--summary-provider`, `--summary-pipeline-log {on,off}`, `--event NAME=on|off` (five event types), `--max-events-per-minute`, `--daily-spend-cap`, `--monthly-spend-cap`, `--event-retention-days`, `--interrupt-on-reply {on,off}`, and `--reset [--reset-section NAME]`.
- Quiet-hours can now be managed from the CLI without hand-editing `config.toml`: `voiccce config --quiet-hours {on,off}`, `--quiet-hours-from HH:MM`, `--quiet-hours-to HH:MM`, `--quiet-hours-voice {on,off}`, `--quiet-hours-desktop {on,off}`.
- Config backup/restore: every config write keeps a timestamped `config.toml.bak-*` (unique within a second), and `voiccce config --list-backups` / `voiccce config --restore [BACKUP]` list and roll back to a backup (the current file is backed up first, and the restore is validated before replacing).
- Timed idle reminders: when a session finishes and you do not reply, the daemon speaks one short nudge (e.g. "<project> ждёт твоего ответа.") timed to fire shortly before the agent's prompt cache expires (Claude's ~5-min window minus a 1-min margin → ~4 min), so a reply still lands on a warm cache. It is one-shot per idle period and is cancelled as soon as you reply. Configure via `[reminders]` or `voiccce config --idle-reminders {on,off}` / `--idle-reminder-margin MIN`.
- Global stop-speaking hotkey. While the menu bar app runs, a system-wide keyboard shortcut (default `⌥⌘S`) instantly silences the current announcement from any app — handy on a meeting or when you've already read the message. It uses Carbon's `RegisterEventHotKey`, so no Accessibility/Input-Monitoring permission is needed and only the chosen combo is captured. Configure it three ways: the new `Stop hotkey` submenu in the menu bar, a picker during `voiccce setup` (or `--hotkey`), or `voiccce config --hotkey "ctrl+alt+cmd+."` (`--hotkey off` disables it). Lives under `[hotkey]` in `config.toml`.
- Free-form notification language setting for AI summaries. `voiccce setup` now asks for a language name, `voiccce setup --language Spanish` and `voiccce config --language Spanish` persist it, and the menu bar exposes a `Notification language` entry.
- Local SQLite event queue and daemon.
- Claude Code hook collector and personal settings installer.
- Session-aware notification state with deduplication, grouping, and stale/conflicting event suppression.
- English notification text with configurable templates.
- macOS `say`, desktop notification, terminal, and OpenAI TTS delivery.
- Local secret loading from environment variables, `~/.voiccce/.env`, or macOS Keychain.
- Optional macOS menu bar companion with stop-speaking, mute, daemon controls, and quick access to config/logs.
- Runtime voice controls: `stop-speaking`, `mute`, and `unmute`.

### Changed
- The menu bar now stays open after you change a setting. macOS dismisses a menu on any click, so after a toggle/selection (voice, engine, model, language, event toggles, idle reminder, integrations, hotkey) Voiccce re-opens the menu — letting you change several settings and run "Play test audio" without re-clicking the menu bar each time.
- `voiccce update` is now a first-class command: it reports the version before and after, re-applies hooks for every wired agent, and runs a post-update health probe. With a local checkout it reinstalls from that source; with none (e.g. a non-editable pipx install) it self-fetches from `git+https://github.com/blackbalancef/voiccce@main`. New flags: `--source`, `--ref`, `--dev` (editable install), `--no-hooks`, `--no-probe`, `--no-restart`. This replaces the manual "git pull + pipx install --force" update story.
- `voiccce config` now writes `config.toml` atomically and migrates older config files in place, so concurrent reads never see a half-written file.
- `voiccce setup` is now a guided interactive wizard. It gathers every choice up front before doing any work: (1) a checkbox picker for which agents to wire (Claude Code, Codex, pi), (2) a text prompt for the AI-summary language, (3) a new voice picker to choose OpenAI TTS or the offline macOS voice, and (4) a yes/no prompt for the menu bar app. `↑`/`↓` navigate, `space` toggles, `a` selects all, `enter` confirms, `esc` cancels. Each menu is skipped when the matching flag is passed: a target (`claude-code`/`codex`/`pi`/`both`), `--language`, `--openai`/`--local`, or `--menubar`/`--no-menubar`. The new `--openai` flag forces OpenAI TTS without showing the voice picker.

### Privacy
- Disclosed the summary pipeline log. When AI summaries are enabled, `~/.voiccce/summary.log` (mode `0600`, rotated to `summary.log.1`) stores the pipeline in plaintext: the assistant's last message, the prompt, the model's output, and the final spoken text. It is on by default and can be disabled with `voiccce config --summary-pipeline-log off` (and cleared with `voiccce clear --history`). The default `summary_privacy_level` remains `full_last_message`, which sends the assistant's last message to OpenAI; `metadata_only` limits this to the short notification text. README and SECURITY.md were corrected accordingly.

### Fixed
- The "Idle reply reminder" toggle (and `--idle-reminders`/`[reminders].enabled`) now governs BOTH reminder paths: the new timer AND the older event-driven "after completion, agent needs input" reminder. Turning it off previously silenced only the timer, so the event-driven reminder kept speaking. Existing configs that still carry the old verbose default reminder text ("…while the cache is still warm") are upgraded in place to the short one-liner on next load; custom reminder text is left untouched.
- The `voiccce setup` test notification is now spoken in the configured language (it hardcoded the English "Voiccce is ready.", so a Russian install heard the test in English even though real notifications were localized).
- Idle reminders are now a short one-line nudge ("<project> is waiting for your reply." / "<project> ждёт твоего ответа.") instead of the long "reply within N minutes while the cache is warm" sentence.
- Quiet hours are now actually enforced. The `[quiet_hours]` window (enabled by default, 23:00–09:00) suppresses voice playback while still showing desktop notifications.
- The `max_events_per_minute` rate limit (default 6) is now enforced.
- Daily and monthly spend caps are now enforced: once a cap is reached, Voiccce falls back to the free macOS voice instead of billing OpenAI.
- Event retention is now enforced: processed events older than `event_retention_days` (default 30) are auto-pruned and the database vacuumed.
- Daemon resilience: the daemon now writes a heartbeat and recovers from transient errors, which `voiccce doctor` reports on.
- `stop-speaking` now cancels pending OpenAI TTS playback and terminates voice playback process groups.
- pi integration now honors `PI_CODING_AGENT_DIR`, so alternate profiles such as `pi-personal` (which runs `PI_CODING_AGENT_DIR=$HOME/.pi-personal/agent pi`) get the extension installed into their own extensions directory instead of always `~/.pi/agent/extensions/`. Without this, voiccce stayed silent for pi-personal because pi never discovered the extension.
