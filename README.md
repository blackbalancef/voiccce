Voiccce is the spoken status layer for parallel AI coding agents. It turns local agent lifecycle hooks into short, project-aware briefings that explain what happened, what passed or failed, and when the agent needs a decision: "Claude Code in frontend needs permission to install dependencies"; "Codex in api finished. All tests pass"; "Claude Code in payments failed while running the test suite."

Run several agents at once and let Voiccce tell you which project needs attention, finished cleanly, or failed.

## Quick start

Install from source, then run the setup wizard:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/blackbalancef/voiccce.git
cd voiccce
pipx install --force .
voiccce setup both
```

No OpenAI API key? Use the built-in macOS voice:

```bash
voiccce setup both --local
```

Omit `both` to choose interactively, or pass one target explicitly: `claude-code`, `codex`, or `pi`.

<details>
<summary>What does setup configure?</summary>

`voiccce setup` configures OpenAI TTS with voice `marin` (or macOS `say` with `--local`), stores your OpenAI key in the macOS Keychain when needed, installs hooks/extensions, starts the daemon, and sends a test notification.

If Codex was already running, restart the Codex app or `codex app-server`, then open `/hooks` in Codex and trust the Voiccce hooks.

</details>

## Requirements

- macOS, for voice playback and desktop notifications.
- Python 3.12+.
- `pipx` (`brew install pipx && pipx ensurepath`).
- Claude Code, Codex CLI, or pi.
- Optional: an OpenAI API key for the recommended voice and AI summaries. `--local` works offline with macOS `say`.

## Project status

Voiccce is currently alpha. The core workflow is usable, but CLI and configuration formats may change before v1.0.

## Features

- Parallel-session aware: notifications include the agent and project name.
- Local-first queue: hooks write sanitized events to SQLite under `~/.voiccce`.
- Grouping and deduplication: repeated lifecycle events are batched and cooled down.
- Spoken summary delivery: OpenAI TTS, macOS `say`, desktop notifications, and terminal logs.
- Runtime controls: stop speech, mute temporarily, or manage the daemon from the CLI.
- Optional menu bar app: quick mute, stop-speaking, daemon, config, log, and spend controls.
- AI summaries: completed-session updates can be rewritten into concise spoken reports.
- English and Russian message templates.

## How it works

```mermaid
flowchart LR
    A[Claude Code / Codex / pi] -->|Lifecycle hooks| B[Voiccce hook]
    B --> C[(Local SQLite queue)]
    C --> D[Background daemon]
    D --> E[Session state, grouping, summaries]
    E --> F{Delivery backend}
    F --> G[OpenAI TTS]
    F --> H[macOS say]
    F --> I[Desktop notification]
    F --> J[Terminal log]
```

Hooks enqueue sanitized events locally. The daemon reads pending events, suppresses duplicates, groups related sessions, optionally generates a short summary, and sends the final notification through the configured delivery backend.

Everything Voiccce stores lives under `~/.voiccce/`, including `config.toml`, `events.sqlite3`, daemon logs, and menu bar logs.

## Configuration

The main config file is `~/.voiccce/config.toml`. Restart the daemon after manual edits.

```bash
voiccce config --language ru
voiccce config --voice cedar
voiccce config --voice-backend macos_say
voiccce config --voice-backend openai_tts --voice marin
voiccce stop && voiccce start
```

<details>
<summary>OpenAI key and voice backend</summary>

`voiccce setup` stores the OpenAI key in the macOS Keychain. Voiccce resolves the key from `OPENAI_API_KEY`, then `~/.voiccce/.env`, then Keychain.

```bash
voiccce secret status openai
voiccce secret set openai
voiccce secret delete openai
voiccce setup --reset-key
```

Use `voiccce setup --local` or `voiccce config --voice-backend macos_say` to run without a key.

</details>

Completed-session events can be rewritten into concise spoken explanations. The default config uses `provider = "openai"` and `model = "gpt-5.4-nano"` when credentials are available. Set `[summary].enabled = false` for template-only messages, or use `privacy_level = "metadata_only"` to summarize the already-short notification text.

## Menu bar

The optional macOS menu bar companion gives quick controls without opening a terminal:

```bash
pipx inject voiccce pyobjc-framework-Cocoa
voiccce menubar-start
```

It shows estimated spend and audio stats, and offers Stop Speaking, Mute 10 min / 1 hour, Unmute, Start/Stop Daemon, Open Config, and Open Daemon Log.

```bash
voiccce stop-speaking
voiccce mute --for 10m
voiccce unmute
voiccce menubar-stop
```

## Useful commands

```bash
voiccce status
voiccce events --limit 20
voiccce test
voiccce --help
```

The legacy `agent-chime` and `agent-voice` commands are compatibility aliases for `voiccce`. To update from source: `git pull --ff-only`, reinstall with `pipx install --force .`, then restart the daemon.

## Privacy

Voiccce runs locally. Claude Code, Codex, and pi hook payloads are normalized and sanitized before storage; the SQLite database keeps metadata and the short notification summary, not the complete hook payload.

When OpenAI TTS is enabled, only the final notification sentence is sent to the speech endpoint. When AI summaries are enabled, the selected summary input is sent to the OpenAI Responses API before delivery. With the local macOS `say` backend and summaries disabled, voice delivery stays on-device.

See [SECURITY.md](SECURITY.md) for secret handling and reporting guidance.

## Development

Run tests with `python3 -m unittest discover -s tests`. Read [CONTRIBUTING.md](CONTRIBUTING.md) and [SECURITY.md](SECURITY.md) before opening changes that affect hooks, storage, delivery, or secrets.
